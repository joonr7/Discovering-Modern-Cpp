# Build & Run with Colcon
`colcon` is required. (Installing ros2 is helpful.)
I think there should be another way to build my code.

```bsh
user@computer:~/Discovering-Modern-Cpp$ colcon build
Starting >>> exercise1-1
Starting >>> sample
Finished <<< exercise1-1 [0.40s]
Finished <<< sample [0.39s]

Summary: 2 packages finished [0.49s]
user@computer:~/Discovering-Modern-Cpp$ ./build/sample/sample
hello world

user@computer:~/Discovering-Modern-Cpp$
```
